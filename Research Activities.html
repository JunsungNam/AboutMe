      <br />- Conducted research throughout two years of high school.<br />-
      Refuted the existing theory that the eyespots on insects’ wings or bodies
      increase their survival rate by making predators perceive them as larger
      predators.
      <br />- Published a paper on these research results in Open Science
      Journal.<br /><br />

      <br />- Researched the growth reaction of a special crop of wild ginseng
      according to the wavelength and duty ratio of the light source in the
      plant factory.
      <br />- Measured the diameter, weight of the ground, and underground parts
      of Panax ginseng in various environmental conditions.
      <br />- Measured respiration rate and photosynthesis rate.
      <br />- Published the article in Creative Critical Thinking, a youth
      journal.

      <br />- Conducted a study about the effect of allelochemicals on seed
      germinability.
      <br />- After treatment of extractant, the germination capacity of
      radishes was measured with Bradford assay, revealing that the substance
      suppresses temporary seed germination but does not affect the overall
      germination ability.
